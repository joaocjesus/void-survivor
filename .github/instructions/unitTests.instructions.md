After any changes to **/*.ts files make sure to create unit tests to add any coverage for the changes. If you modify existing functionality, ensure that you also update the corresponding tests to reflect the changes.

If no unit tests are needed, please mention it. 

Please make sure that all unit tests are written in a clear and concise manner, following the Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern. Each test should focus on a single behavior or outcome, and include setup, execution, and verification steps. Additionally, ensure that tests are isolated and do not depend on external state or other tests.

Please run the unit tests to ensure that everything is working as expected. If you add new tests, make sure they are also included in the test suite and cover the relevant functionality.
